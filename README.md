Web App Project | Graduate Career Platform

4-50six is a group project developed during my time in the ALX Professional Foundations course. As a team, we were tasked with selecting a real-world problem and building a solution around it.
My proposed problem statement focused on youth unemploymentâ€”specifically among recent graduates. After a round of idea pitching, my solution was selected by the group and became the foundation for our project.

The name "4-50six" was inspired by the resilient character 456 in the Netflix series Squid Game, symbolizing perseverance and resourcefulnessâ€”traits many graduates need to succeed in todayâ€™s job market.
